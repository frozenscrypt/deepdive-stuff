Remnants of a research work I was involved in. This work actually took off to a point that we were able to write something concrete for publishing a paper in a conference. I worked on it as the second author. The abstract was submitted to IJCAI. But due to circumstances and deadlines, the final print never was submitted. And life went ON!

## Structure


* Introduction
	* What and Why is the problem?
	* Motivation and policy impact, real world implications
	* Include brief discussion of related works here.
	* Challenges at solving the problem, e.g. labor intensive model design
	* How we automate the process and reduce search space
* Agent Model
	* Expand on PsychSim and Anthrax paper to give better background on current work
	* Define model states/variables/Transitions of our model expanding on previous paper
* Dynamics Generation
	* Explain how the dynamics are generated
* Experiments
	* Verification: Different levels of granularity/abstraction
	* Verification: Comparison of Model with Random Baseline
	* Validation: Comparison with real data
	* Optimization/Search Space: Improve model dynamics
* Conclusion
	* Is the model any better than manual effort?
	* Are there disadvantages?
	* Bias that can be introduced by choice of actions and beliefs
